I think the next few days are going to be rough. Me and Babs have not been in sync for the last few days and we need to come back together.  I have noticed a wall that has come up between us and a lot of it is the fact that we have not been communicating effectively with each other.  I not sure what happened but in the end we need to get back on track.  I have been feeling like I am lagging behind when I am with her and I donâ€™t feel like I understand what she says or wants.  I am not sure what to ask and when I try I just stumble over my words.  I want to be a good partner so I am ready to listen and hear.  I am ready to adjust where I can and be present and ready.  I do not want to continue to be insular and fail to hear what I need to hear.

Derek remember that you are not a island alone You need to be ready to hear but also let people know how you feel.  You can not continue to be a rock in the river.  The world is no longer flowing pass you and you are no longer alone. You can change and you have so step up and speak your mind.
