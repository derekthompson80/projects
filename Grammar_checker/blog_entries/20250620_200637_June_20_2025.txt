It's going to be rough for a while as I try and get back out there.  I lost my job and I am worried that I will be useless. I am scared that I don't have any skills and I will become obsolete.  How do people do this how do people just change.  I just want to go to work and be a productive member of society and I was just told I am so not needed.

Babs has been a boon but we already have so much to work on.

Keep you head up Derek you will over come thing because you have too.
