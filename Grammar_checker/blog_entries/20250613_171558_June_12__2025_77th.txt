When you make a error you need to correct the mistake because the world remembers.  I made a lot of mistakes and the world remembers.  I feel like I have been climbing out of a pit and the walls crumble under my hands and feet.  This is the problem with lies and being a terrible person.  You do not get to forget and you should not forget.  You need to keep climbing because you have to change and the only way out is to keep moving.  

Babs is being hurt by my lies and its a constant battle to move and continue to be better.  I need to change everything about myself and its hard because for a long time the best plan of action I had was to move on and let the pain of the past move by me.  That is no longer a opinion I want to be here and present in my life and I am tired.  I want to stand up and I am scared.  I am not the victim so I need to make it right.  

Over the next few weeks I need to get answers to all of Babs questions.  I need to look where I spent moeny and where I was going during that time.  I need to be ready to handle the pain and anger and know that I am the cause of all the pain in my partners life.  I need to be ready.

I need to work with my therapist and figured out how to handle this without falling back.  I need to stand firm and not crumble.  Again remember you have to make it right and its not oke to hide behind your trama.  Its not ok lie.  Its not oke to side step.  Its not oke to not own it.
