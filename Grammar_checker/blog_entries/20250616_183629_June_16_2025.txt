I have been wondering for a while now what I need to do to fix my communication problems.  It's becoming a larger issue as I try to heal.  I try to engage and I feel like I am running into a wall, and it bothers me.  I think the problem is that I don't express or open up to anyone and I hide how I feel behind a mask of normalcy.  This isn't working and I am being crushed by the ongoing lack of understanding from those around me.  I watch as Babs grows bored or just looks away from me.  I watch as my mom continues the same conversation we always have and people stop reaching out because I don't offer anything in return.  I think it's time I readjust how I view the world and work on this.

My mind is healing now it's time to focus in on my character and stop pretending that going along to get along is enough.  I need to speak up more and tell people how I feel.
