It is father's day, and for the first time I was asked what I wanted to do for it.  I was a little taken aback, but I am so happy to be asked this question because it's something I have been wanting to hear and be a part of it.  I wanted to be a father to help someone grow and nature them.  I wanted to see life grow and to see them grow.  It is a regret that I never got to have children.  I am content now, but for a long time it was a pain point that I never had children.

Sex is a big word and a question that has been asked a lot in my lifetime.  What do I like what I want to know about it?  I have been trying to get answers for myself and for my partners.  I have sadly found that I am lost when it comes to not only sex but opening up my ideas and life to it.  I want to know more, I want to try more, but sometimes I feel like a child when it comes to sex.  You hear how people have wild fantasy and I am just not sure where my ideas and dreams fit.  I wish I could come up with a better answer, but most times I am just trying to get by.  I like feeling my partner I like knowing that they are satisfied, and I like the feel of seeming them after sex.

I have been thinking a lot about who I am and why I lie.  It's not something I can answer easily, but I believe I lie first because I am confused and then I don't want to admit I am confused.  I lie because I don't know the answer, and so instead of saying I don't know, I make up an excuse or lie.  I lie because I don't want to get in trouble and I don't want to be wrong.  I lie for banal reasons.  I need to find happiness in my life that does not leave me broken from the pain I cause others and the pain I cause myself through
