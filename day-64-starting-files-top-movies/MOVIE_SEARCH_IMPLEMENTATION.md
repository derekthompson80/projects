# Movie Search Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the movie search and add functionality for the Top Movies application. The implementation allows users to search for movies using The Movie Database API, select a movie from the search results, and add it to their personal movie collection with ratings and reviews.

## Features Implemented

1. **Movie Search Form**
   - Modified the `/add` route to use a simple form with just a movie title field
   - Used the FindMovieForm class which contains only a title field and submit button

2. **API Integration**
   - Integrated with The Movie Database API for movie searches
   - Used the API key: `1746088d2b0e9fe4217ab1a981d13858`
   - Implemented search functionality in the `/add` route

3. **Search Results Display**
   - Updated the `select.html` template to display search results
   - Each result shows the movie title and release year
   - Each movie is linked to a details page via the movie ID

4. **Movie Details and Database Storage**
   - Created a `/find/<id>` route to fetch detailed movie information
   - The route retrieves movie details including title, year, description, and poster image
   - Creates a new Movie object and stores it in the database
   - Redirects to the edit page for adding rating and review

5. **Rating and Review**
   - Reused the existing edit functionality to allow users to add ratings and reviews
   - After adding rating and review, users are redirected to the home page

## API Endpoints Used

1. **Movie Search**
   - Endpoint: `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie`
   - Parameters: `api_key`, `query` (movie title)
   - Returns a list of movies matching the search query

2. **Movie Details**
   - Endpoint: `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{id}`
   - Parameters: `api_key`
   - Returns detailed information about a specific movie

## User Flow

1. User clicks "Add Movie" on the home page
2. User enters a movie title and submits the form
3. User is presented with a list of movies matching their search
4. User selects a movie from the list
5. The application fetches detailed information about the selected movie
6. The movie is added to the database
7. User is redirected to the edit page to add rating and review
8. After submitting rating and review, user is redirected to the home page

## Testing

A test script (`test_movie_api.py`) was created to verify the API integration. The script tests:
- Searching for movies using the API
- Retrieving detailed information about a specific movie
- Constructing the correct image URL for movie posters

## Future Improvements

1. Add error handling for API requests
2. Implement pagination for search results
3. Add more search filters (year, genre, etc.)
4. Cache API responses to reduce API calls
5. Add user authentication to allow multiple users to have their own movie collections
