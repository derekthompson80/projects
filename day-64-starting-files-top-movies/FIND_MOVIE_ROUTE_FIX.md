# Find Movie Route Fix

## Issue Description
The issue was reported as "app.route for find_movie not working". This route is responsible for fetching movie details from The Movie Database API when a user selects a movie from the search results, and then adding the movie to the database.

## Investigation
After thorough testing, we found that the basic functionality of the find_movie route was working correctly in a controlled test environment. However, the route lacked proper error handling, which could cause it to fail in real-world scenarios with:

1. API request failures
2. Network connectivity issues
3. Incomplete or unexpected data from the API
4. Missing fields in the API response

These issues would cause the route to throw unhandled exceptions, resulting in a 500 Internal Server Error instead of a user-friendly error message.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Improved Error Handling
The find_movie route was enhanced with comprehensive error handling to gracefully handle various failure scenarios:

- **API Request Failures**: Now checks the status code of the API response and displays an appropriate error message if the request fails.
- **Incomplete Data**: Validates that the required fields (title and overview) are present in the API response before attempting to create a Movie object.
- **Network Errors**: Catches and handles RequestException errors that might occur during the API request.
- **Key Errors**: Catches and handles KeyError exceptions that might occur when accessing missing fields in the API response.
- **General Exceptions**: Catches any other unexpected exceptions that might occur during processing.

### 2. Error Template
Created a new `error.html` template to display user-friendly error messages when something goes wrong. The template includes:

- A clear error message
- Navigation buttons to return to the home page or try adding another movie
- Consistent styling with the rest of the application

### 3. Logging
Added logging of errors to help with debugging and monitoring:

- API request failures are logged with the status code and response text
- Incomplete data is logged with the received data
- Network errors and other exceptions are logged with their error messages

## Testing
Comprehensive testing was performed to verify the fix:

1. **Basic Functionality Test**: Verified that the route works correctly in the happy path scenario.
2. **Full User Flow Test**: Tested the entire flow from search to adding a movie to ensure all components work together.
3. **Error Handling Tests**: Created unit tests for various error scenarios:
   - API request failures (404 Not Found)
   - Incomplete data from the API
   - Network errors
   - Key errors when processing the API response

All tests passed successfully, confirming that the route now handles both successful and error scenarios appropriately.

## Future Recommendations

1. **API Key Management**: Consider moving the API key to an environment variable or configuration file for better security.
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for API requests to avoid hitting API usage limits.
3. **Caching**: Consider caching API responses to improve performance and reduce API calls.
4. **Input Validation**: Add more validation for user inputs, especially the movie ID parameter.
5. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for API errors to detect issues early.

## Conclusion
The find_movie route now works reliably in all scenarios, providing a better user experience by handling errors gracefully and displaying user-friendly error messages when something goes wrong.
