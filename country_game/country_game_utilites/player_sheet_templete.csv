,"I. LEAD THE UNITED FEDERATION TROOP EFFORT
MILITARY 4 + SIZE 3

Athanasios Therinae Aurelianus of House Therinae will call upon all troops within Therendrim and that answer to our generals, and send them to the Rohevan entrance to Morgaard to fight alongside the other United Federation troops.

MILITARY ( AMPHIBIOUS WARFARE ) ADVISOR: General expertise of warfare and the military efforts seem important to this task, and he should be able to lend them.
",,,,,,,,,,,"GUILD ACTION: QUEST FOR PRIMEAN APOCRYPHA ABOUT THE FEMININE ASPECT

We would like to spend for an Adventurers Guild action this turn the Empire of Therendrim would like to purchase the services of an elite cohort of adventurers, merchants, and faith scholars who will be hired to seek out, identify, and acquire ancient remnants, lost knowledge, and holy relics associated with the ancient Therin Empire or Primean Apocrypha. These include forgotten or lesser known gospels and other writings by early Primean worshipers which provide accounts of his message, nature, and teachings from him and his champions. All gnostic style alternative scriptures, religious esoterica, or similar objects of significance would be highly appreciated — especially any on a feminine personification of the supreme female divine principle or the transcendent Primean mysteries.

Search efforts should be focused to realistically plausible distant lands or overseas so that lesser known prophetic revelations outside the usual span of Primean attention, and to reclaim looted or lost relics previously thought destroyed. This is not a loot, steal, or pillage mission and must be conducted in accordance with high virtue. However, where there are evil creatures who possess our good works, let their blade be true. 5 ( G ) spent on this.

MILITARY UPDATE:

I mentioned it in my last actions, but the extra gold committed to my battlegroups needs to be brought down to whatever is the minimum required cost — not remain at 3 ( G ) each, since it’s destroying my budget.

Additionally, ARMY 5 and ARMY 6 will be deployed at the northernmost island of Malim to continue securing the land and protecting Dark Tapestry efforts, while ARMY 1, ARMY 3, and ARMY 4 will be withdrawn to return and be positioned in northeast border between Therendrim and the Holy Primean Empire.

2 TEXTILES ( T1 ) are to be sold in towns.

TRADE ROUTE UPDATES ( ALREADY ON SHEET, NEED TO BE CHANGED ):

JURAI TO THERENDRIM: EXPORT 1 TEXTILES ( T1 ) + 1 WINE ( T2 ) TO JURAI & IMPORT 1 SLAVES ( T1 ) + 2 LUMBER ( T0 ) INTO THERENDRIM.


TRADE ROUTE ADDITIONS ( ACTIONS DONE BUT NOT UPDATED ON THE SHEET ):

KENHALL TO THERENDRIM: EXPORT 1 SPICE ( T2 ) + 1 HARDWOOD ( T1 ) TO KENHALL & IMPORT 2 DIRECROPS ( T2 ) INTO THERENDRIM.

( I also think my new town is built at position ""A""if that means I get an extra town and freed resources. https://i.imgur.com/SILtEIe.gif )

There's a few Resources on my sheet that aren't selectable, could they maybe be added like the other ones?

Oh, lastly, what was my NPC Bonus Action last season and could the response for this turn specify which they do this turn?

,"II. INVOKE THE OATHS OF EMRIDAR
RELIGION 5 + MILITARY 4

Athanasios Therinae Aurelianus of House Therinae, first of his name and last of his house, will march to Outpost XVII in the nation of Emrindar and with the Sword of Gwynned in his right hand and the Emperor’s Scepter in his left hand, call upon the Knights of Primus, who through the first Pontiff transformed their oaths of service to the Therin Empire into an oath of service to Primus, until such a time there is a Therin Emperor once more. He does not ask for total obedience from the Second Legion or ask that they disobey sacred service as the Knights of Primus.

Instead he asks the Lord-General, Lords-Captain of Emridar, and all those who inhabit the ancient Outpost XVII to keep the oaths sworn by the Second Legion to the Therin Empire and to fulfill the sacred covenant made by the Knights of Primus to the Archangel Arthiel.

He asks not to turn from the light of Primus in order to serve the Therin Empire once more, but instead to do both, and through our righteous faith resume service to the throne while they continue pious obedience to the lord — march forward to Rohevan and fight in this crusade against Morgaard, against all most vile evils, and fulfill the promises their mystically binding oaths require.

The plan is to do this before King Lance of Morgaard has a chance to do so, and in order to call upon their sacred oath before the throne they serve is forever changed.

RELIGION ( GNOSTICISM / SYNCRETISM ) ADVISOR: Since this process is so important and involves a Primean religious aspect with the historical oaths sworn to the Therin Emperors, it seems like this advisor is essential to pulling off this trick.

,"III. RENOUNCE THE THERIN THRONE ( WITH EMPRESS KEMMLER )
SOCIETY 3 + SIZE 3

Athanasios Therinae Aurelianus of House Therinae understands that the vile King Lance of Morgaard has at his fingertips the power to corrupt any action by a claimant to the Therin Throne, and for that reason after the oaths sworn by Emrindar have been invoked he plans to announce an end to the Therin Throne — and rather than give up or contest for the title, retire it publicly alongside Empress Kemmler of the Holy Primean Empire.

As the direct descendant of House Therinae, Athanasios Therinae Aurelianus will announce that the time has come for Therendrim, literally translated as Children of the Therins, to come of age. Not to cling onto our ancestor's world, or forsake that history, and instead of trying to become the great Therin Empire once again, we set our goal as one to define our own empire, an empire born of Therin, but an empire defined by itself rather than those before it — to become themselves on their own, as all parents wish for their children.

Athanasios Therinae Aurelianus chooses to embrace his birthright as a Therin Emperor, and to sever the chain of that throne as the last Therin Emperor, for the good of all the people he serves and out of respect for that sacred line which deserves a suitable successor instead of a stagnant shadow.

,"IV. UNIVERSAL CALL TO PRAYER
RELIGION 5 + SOCIETY 3

As a way to give thanks to our lord and as a general anti-corruption effort, Athanasios Therinae Aurelianus will lead a mass call for prayer to Primus across all of the United Federation to thanks for the strength he has given us and to appeal for the strength needed to meet this moment — one unified moment of faith across all Primean nations, with the other noble faiths welcome and encouraged to join in. This includes nightly vigils among our civilian population, fasting until sundown, and libations made to the dead and the great ancient of ancients above them.

ECONOMIC ( DEVELOPMENT ) ADVISOR: This effort is mostly straightforward but could use some additional expertise to ensure we reach out to all of the faithful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
