There are a number of different nations to play as the ruler of, each with its own unique challenges and advantages.  Each nation speaks best to certain styles of play.  Below is a list of nations, short descriptions, and notations as to who is playing them.  These are not the only nations on the continent, but all other nations are minor powers and not balanced for play.
 
1. Alaria - LG - Feudal Monarchy - Mid-sized country based on classic fantasy medieval kingdoms. Think Arthurian Camelot.
2. Rohevan - NG - Democratic Republic - Small nation in which the ruler is an elected official selected by common vote. Much of the play of this nation is devoted to maintaining your popularity amongst the people to remain in office.
3. Holy Primean Empire - N - Balkanized Empire - With a reigning monarch that is elected to serve for life, the Empire is one of the least organized and controlled entities in the game.  While technically the largest of the nations, the empire is composed of a mass of substates that pretty much do what they want.  Think the Holy Roman Empire at its weakest.
4. Primean Papal States - LG - Theocracy - This smallish nation dominates the religion of several nations, and its ruler, the Patriarch is responsible for the souls of the members of all Primean nations (Alaria, Rohevan, Therendrim, Durus, and theoretically the protestant Athasian League, as well as several minor powers).
5. Therendrim - LN - Constitutional Monarchy - Middle sized nation that is heir to an ancient empire that spanned the eastern half of the continent.  Much of play centers around getting the nobility to do what you want them to and balancing that with international issues.
6. Durus - Bureaucratic Ministries - LN - Medium-sized nation devoted to order through better mind control.  This nation is led by an appointed bureaucratic minister.  The psionic heritage of the Durun people also gives them fantastic leverage in the world of espionage.  Think 1984 meets D&D.
7. Athasian League - Hanseatic Trade League - LG - Large nation composed of several city states led by a chairman, generally the best merchant among them.  The Athasians are a major trade power.  They are also the only major Primean nation to reject the religious rule of the Patriarch, putting them at odds with many of their neighbors.
8. Ti’vashni - Matriarchal Naturalists - NG - Medium nation that is physically and culturally isolated from its neighbors.  Noted for their strong following of the Druidic faith and feared for their unicorn cavalry.
9. Celistark - Tribal Kingdom - CN - Large country composed of several fierce and proud tribes of warriors, poets, and sailors.  This nation is feared for its seaborne raiders, and much of the player experience lies in dealing with infighting, dangerous neighbors, and occasionally preying on the weak.  Think Vikings and Celts rammed together at high speeds.
10. Morgaard - Cursed Kingdom - CE - Large nation culturally devoted to the greater evil.  The land is cursed and blighted.  This nation is at what could be a turning point in it’s history, either a paladin has put down the lich king/queen OR the lich king/queen has put down the paladin and declared rule with an iron fist.  Either way, managing this country within the greater world will not be easy.  
11. Khazak Dhur - Dwarven Thanedom - LG - One of the richest nations, this country is beset by enemies.  Most of the nation is beneath the mountains at the center of the continent, making the country very central to the shape of world politics.
12. Levain - Tribal Gerontocracy - N - This smallish country is absolutely the poorest, least advanced nation in the game, this country is ruled by its eldest member. Their primary advantage is their powerful union with the spirits of the land who nurture and defend them, tending to most of their needs.
13. Stildar - Lizardfolk and Human Confederacy - NE - This large nation is a fairly backwards, swamp filled land ruled by lizardfolk.  The rich resources of this land provide much opportunity for someone who can overcome the clannish nature of the people and provide the necessary guidance to build them into a strong country.
14. Voresh - Autocracy - LE - Slaver nation and major economic power.  The country is a small, marshy nation built on the backs of the slave trade, and is a powerhouse of human capital.
15. Ostwil - Trade Based City-State - N - Perhaps the greatest of the trading powers of the world, this tiny nation has trades and contacts flung all over the known world.
16. Freeport of Karanex - Pirate Kingdom (Kleptocracy) - CE - A tiny country run from the massive fortress Skull Mountain, the Karanexi plunder the massively lucrative inner sea trade to sustain themselves.  A particularly predatory playing experience.
17. Jurai - Satrapy-based Sultanate - LE - One of the most powerful nations in the world, the Jurai are ancient in their acquaintance with political infighting, intrigue, and danger.  Massively cosmopolitan, the Jurai have hundreds of different peoples, languages, and customs within their borders, all owing fealty to their sultan. 
18. Akhen - Absolute Theocratic Autocracy - NE - This small nation is ruled by a God-King.  Within the borders of this country, anything that the ruler wants, the ruler gets.  He can reshape, kill, and revive the people of his country how he wills, for it is his place to rule.  However, those massive powers end at the border of his nation. 
19. Korim - Tribal Confederacy - CN - The people of this relatively primitive mid sized nation view themselves through one lens alone, their holy duty to once per generation have their whole adult populace fight the greatest beast the world has ever known, the Tarrasque. 
20. Karis - Messianic Tribal Monarchy - CN - This is a mid-sized desert nation ruled by a prophesied monarch who, it is said, will lead the people to a land of plenty.  The people of this nation don’t have much, but are a fierce and powerful people.  Think the Aiel from Wheel of Time or the Fremen from dune. 
21. Ashen’gar - Goblinoid Hegemonic Stratocracy - LE - This large nation is home to many different sub fiefdoms of goblinoids.  
22. Elvenhome - Socialist Monarchy - CN - This small to middling elven nation is the ancient home of the long-lived elven people.  They are rich in magic, lore, and personal freedoms. 
23. Lycaeum - Magocracy - N - The Lycaeum is at its heart the home of the world’s guild of wizards, attempting to regulate the use of arcane power in the world.  More run like a institution of learning than a nation, the Lycaeum presents unique challenges to the person playing it, as it must balance neutrality with the practical goals of the advancement of magic in the world. 
24. Tanaf - Genasi Caliphate - N - Distant cousins of the people of Jurai, the Tanafen are as much related to Geniekind as they are to humanity.  A small country of hidden mysteries and wealth, Tanaf is a power poised on the edge of greatness.  This country has a classic Arabian Nights vibe.
25. Afenthar - Nomadic Dictatorship - CE - A very large nation surrounding several smaller ones, the Horselords of the Afenthar constantly press the nearby peoples for tribute.  Think the Mongol Horde. 
26. Gnomergnan - Gnomish Technocracy - CG - Small country of gnomes who are without a doubt the most technologically advanced people of the world. The gnomes are ruled by someone selected from their guildmasters to run the country and deal with the various extreme threats.  Their military, while not strong, is feared throughout the world for its overwhelming effectiveness. 
27. Veraxis - Draconic Gerontocratic Aristocracy - LE - While dragons don’t usually go around ruling countries, very few people are going to tell them that they can’t.  This small nation is ruled by a clan of blue dragons who consider the peoples of the nation part of their collective hoard. 
28. Vrenzen - Hill Dwarven Plutocratic Monarchy - NG - A small but defensible country squeezed in between some very dangerous neighbors, the Hill Dwarves are a resilient country with many advantages belying its small size. 
29. Prindar - Corporate Autocracy - N  - Having begun as an adventurer’s guild, this nation is built around maintaining that function.  Staunchly neutral, they offer their services in problem solving and problem causing to other nations in exchange for large fees. 
30. Kenhall - Libertarian Halfling Kingdom - NG - This small nation produces vast quantities of food that feeds many of the surrounding nations.  A fiercely independent people dedicated to their homes and defending them, it is also home to wanderers and the major center of trade on the north coast.
31. Galiaca - Merfolk Monarchy - N - After many years apart the two countries of Asturias and Leon have finally united under a new heir. They are known for their fierce warriors and cunning traders. Their new ruler must balance these two cultures and contend with adversities found only beneath the waves.
32. Ker’Zerak - Drow Spider Queen - CE - Cruel beyond belief, power beyond measure, and a will to dominate everyone.  Drow believe that the elves are a superior race and that all should bow to the true Drow power. They are masters of the Underdark and are known for their devastating clerics of Lolth.  In recent years the Drow have been seen more on the surface and engaging in trade and opening dialogue with their neighbors and more surprising honoring their deals.
