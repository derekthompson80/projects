Major religions are as follows:


Primean Faith (Pr) 
Devoted to Primus, a monotheistic faith that has echoes of medieval Christianity.  The Primean faith is lawful good in alignment, but with its claims that only humans have souls has a limited following amongst nonhumans.  Other major elements include the divine right of kings, a ban on arcane magic (“thou shalt not suffer a witch to live…”), a missionary attitude, a focus on charity and good works, and the care of its followers’ immortal souls (who go to heaven if they follow the church’s rules, and hell if they don’t.)


Reformed Primean Church (PrR) 
Typically, due to actual angels working for the Primean church, it is difficult for its rulers to go bad.  About seventy years ago, a pontiff managed it, and his corruption outraged a number of Athasian bishops, who decided to break from the structure of the church, noting that nowhere in the holy teachings of Primus did it say there should actually be a Patriarch.  Focusing less on the politics end of things and more on the saving of souls, the Reformed Church is a large draw for those dissatisfied with the core mother church.


The Twelve (Tw) 
Millenia ago, invited by the prayers of millions to a world in chaos for anyone, anyone at all, to save them, twelve gods arrived on this world, quieted the tossing continents, and brought a peace of sorts to this world.  Each god in this pantheon represents vastly different outlooks and roles in life.  They are:
* Perelandro - God of orphans, the downtrodden and unfortunate.
* Morgan - God of order, the city, and justice.
* Iono - God of Sea and storms, loves women and cats.
* Aza Guilla - Goddess of Death, Lady of the Long Silence/Night. 
* Venaportha - Goddess with Two Faces. Lady of love.
* Gandolo - God of Coin and Commerce. Filler of vaults
* Nara - Plague Mistress, Lady of Ubiquitous Maladies
* Callo Androno - Eyes on the Crossroads, god of travel, languages and lore. 
* Dama Elliza, mother of rains and reaping
* Sendovani - God of builders, makers, and crafters.
* Azri - The spellcasting god, master of magic
* Preva -  Lady of the Red Madness, Goddess of war


The Lords of Darkness (Da) 
Somewhere, partially trapped in the outer darkness in the space between worlds, are the true masters of the cosmos.  Beings of a scale that perhaps only Io the Ninefold Dragon can comprehend. This pantheon brings destruction, doom, devastation, and corruption to the world in an attempt to unlock their prison and reclaim a universe that is rightly theirs.
* The Herald of Apocalypse (believed to also be Nara of the Twelve.)
* She’thass of the Thousand Eyes, the perception of entropy
* Yg, the corruptor, patron of serpents and undead
* G’k’r-lek’non, lord of the Qlippoth, master of demons
* Tazr, the mouth of darkness
* The Faceless One, leader of the pantheon, the un-namer.


Dwarven Pantheon (Dw) 
A group of gods worshipped by the dwarves, the significant figures are:
* Moradin the Just (believed to also be Morgan of the Twelve)
* Sindar the Builder (believed to also be Sendovani of the Twelve)
* Khelan the Delver
* Azzak the Rememberer
* Balduin the Keeper of Families


Elven Pantheon (El) 
A group of gods worshipped by the elves, which sometimes causes conflicts with the druidic faith that they also practice.  The significant figures are:
* Correlon, lord of poetry, music and battle (believed to also be Callo Androno of the Twelve.)
* Selen, lady of the moon (believed to also be Venaportha of the Twelve.)
* Astimar, master of the sword
* Khelena, mistress of the bow
* Shelasa, mistress of magic
* Anduriel, master of the elements


Druidic Faith (Dr) 
A nature and ancestor worship religion spread throughout the corners of the world, although with relatively few adherents in the modern age, the druidic faith reveres no gods, instead focusing on the primal forces of nature as the things truly worthy of worship, considering humanoid concerns to be petty and useless.  There are four major subsects of this religion, generally separated by region of the continent.
* Keepers of the Balance (Northwest) devoted to teaching the integration of all beings into harmonious systems
* Claws of the World (Northeast) which promotes a “nature red in tooth and claw” attitude with an eye towards survival of the fittest.
* Tenders of the Lifestream (Southcentral) is the smallest sect of the religion, mostly pushing biodiversity in ecosystems and reverence for multiplicity of life forms of all varieties.
* Children of the Earthmother (Southwest) distinctly matriarchal focus, as a faith teaching that there is a great feminine presence that is responsible for the creation and maintenance of all life.


Worship of the God King of Akhen (Ak) 
The subjects of the nation of Akhen view their king as a living god.


Draconic Reverence of Io (Io) 
The thing the dragons worship is not a god in the traditional sense, nor would the dragons be interested in such a thing.  Io is a deeper representation of metaconcepts in the universe, and his faith involves following such rules as “Don’t rewrite time,” and “objects tend to fall.” (In other words, make sure you use physics to accomplish your aims.)  Io is believed to be the entity responsible for the ordering of the outer planes and the traditional ninefold alignment system.


Devotees of the Skyfather (Sk) 
The Skyfather is revered amongst the horselords of the Afenthar.  He demands that all men live lives of greatness and freedom, and turns his face from those that don’t.  He has three daughters, who oversee concepts such as food, family, and magic (believed to be a woman’s art amongst the Afenthar.)


Spirit Worship (Sp) 
The oldest of the religions of the world, the spirits of the land are vast incarnations of raw manifestations of nature, each a tremendous power in its own right.  Over the millennia, their worship has been superseded by that of the gods, and they have been weakened and driven from their places of power. Various tribes swear themselves to the following of various spirits, generally one per distinct people.  (The Afenthar were believed to once follow the spirit of Horse before converting to the worship of the Skyfather, for example.)  The worship of the spirits is strongest in Levain, where most of the Spirit worshippers (and their sponsoring spirits) dwell.  Outside of that, the major centers of spirit worship are Karis and Korim, both of which have unusual relationships with their spirit patrons (having killed their patron spirit and making a point of warring on their patron spirit at its request, respectively.)


Drow Pantheon (Dr) 
The drow mainly worshiped a pantheon of gods called the Dark Seldarine differently from the elves, who venerated one member of their pantheon above the rest while still paying homage to each of their deities the drow gods weren't venerated out of true piety, but out of fear, respect, or ambition.
* Church of Lolth: The church of Lolth is the primary drow faith. Its goal is to strengthen Lolth and her authority by bringing all drow under the church's wing, while killing those who are in any way a challenge to the authority of the Spider Queen and her clergy.
* Church of Vhaeraun: The faith of Vhaeraun is the biggest among surface drow and the second biggest overall among the whole race. Its goal is to re-elevate the Ilythiiri to the position of power they once held, in a society where equality between the sexes reigned. 
* Church of Ghaunadaur: The church of Ghaunadaur believes that everybody capable of strength is allowed to wield power. An idea that has devolved into an extreme form of "might makes right". The Ghaunadans' goal is to promote the faith of their deity and to ensure that he is fed with sacrifices, chiefly by killing followers of other deities and pillaging their temples.
* Church of Kiaransalee: The church of Kiaransalee is a fatalistic cult that concerned itself with vengeance and necromancy. They believed that, through loyal service to the Revenancer, they will be reborn as undead and live forever. Said service consists of killing and re-animating people, while at the same time avenging every slight.
* Church of Selvetarm: The church of Selvetarm, followed by warriors, and guards who constantly hone their fighting skills and revel in battle. Due to its emphasis on individual battle prowess instead of strategy, adhering to this faith blocks a drow from obtaining high positions in the military. Venerating him as an individual deity isn’t tolerated within Lolthite settlements.




Yondalla's Children 
The collective name for the halfling pantheon, which is led by the greater deity Yondalla known as the Protector and Provider, the Nurturing Matriarch, and the Blessed One. Yondalla's Children resided in Venya, the third layer of the Seven Heavens, which they named the Green Fields.


* Yondalla: Goddess and the leader of the halfling pantheon. She was additionally a nature goddess.
* Sheela Peryroyl: Goddess of agriculture, love, and weather. She temporarily took up leadership of the pantheon between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering.
* Urogalan: Demigod of the earth, death, and the halfling dead.
* Arvoreen: God of defense, guardians, and vigilance; he was often regarded by others as a war god.
* Brandobaris: God of thievery, stealth, and curiosity.
* Cyrrollalee: Goddess of friendship, trust, hospitality, and home.
